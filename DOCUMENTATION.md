# SecurePWM — Zero‑Knowledge Password Manager

SecurePWM is a zero‑knowledge password management system. All encryption and decryption occur locally; the vault stores only ciphertext. It features per‑entry envelope encryption, tamper‑evident audit logs, k‑of‑n recovery, policy enforcement, and optional sync — with a clear, contributor‑friendly architecture.
